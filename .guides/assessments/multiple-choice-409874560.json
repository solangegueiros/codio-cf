		"guidance": "The correct answer is that a block explorer is a web application that enables users to view and search blockchain data in real-time. This accurately reflects the definition provided in the topic, which states that a block explorer is an online tool or web application allowing users to view, search, and track information on a blockchain. It serves as a \"window\" into the blockchain, providing access to details about transactions, blocks, addresses, and other relevant data. The other options are incorrect as they describe different blockchain-related concepts or tools, not the specific function of a block explorer.",
