		"guidance": "The correct answers reflect the accurate understanding of cryptographic elements in digital wallets:\n\n1. A public key is used to generate blockchain addresses: This is correct, as public keys are used to derive addresses for various blockchains.\n2. An address is a specific \"location\" on the blockchain where coins can be sent: This accurately describes the function of a blockchain address.\n3. A mnemonic phrase can be used to generate public and private keys: This is true, as mnemonic phrases are often used as a seed to generate key pairs.\n\nThe incorrect options are:\n1. 'A private key should be shared to receive cryptocurrency': This is false and dangerous. Private keys should never be shared; only public addresses derived from public keys should be shared to receive funds.\n2. 'The public key is used to sign transactions': This is incorrect. The private key, not the public key, is used to sign transactions.",
