		"guidance": "The correct answer is \"Private keys must be kept confidential to maintain control over funds\". This is a fundamental principle of cryptocurrency security. Private keys grant full access to the associated cryptocurrency funds, and if compromised, can lead to loss of assets. The other options are incorrect because: sharing private keys, even with trusted individuals, compromises security; storing them in cloud services risks unauthorized access; private keys are not directly used to generate public addresses (public keys are); and private keys cannot be regenerated from public keys due to the nature of asymmetric cryptography.",
