		"guidance": "The correct answer is that the primary function of a digital wallet is to interact with blockchain accounts and authorize transactions. This reflects the wallet's role as an interface for managing blockchain interactions, rather than storing assets directly. The other options are incorrect because: digital wallets don't store cryptocurrencies within the application (they're on the blockchain), wallet providers don't have custody of funds (users retain control), and digital wallets are not physical devices for securing cryptocurrencies (though hardware wallets exist, this isn't the primary function of digital wallets in general).",
