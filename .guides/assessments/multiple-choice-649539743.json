Digital wallets allow users to interact with their blockchain accounts: This is a primary function of digital wallets.\n2. Users can authorize transactions using their digital wallet: This is another key function, enabling users to send and receive cryptocurrencies.\n3. A digital wallet can be used to prove ownership of a blockchain address: This is correct, as wallets can sign messages to verify ownership.\n\nThe incorrect options are:\n1. 'A digital wallet stores cryptocurrencies directly within the application': This is a common misconception. Digital wallets don't store cryptocurrencies; they interact with the blockchain where the assets are recorded.\n2. 'Digital wallets give custody of funds to the wallet provider': This is false. Wallet providers don't have custody of funds; they only provide tools to manage blockchain accounts.",
