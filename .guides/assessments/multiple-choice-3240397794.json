		"guidance": "This question assesses understanding of the differences between ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards. The correct options highlight key distinctions: ERC-20 tokens are fungible and interchangeable, while ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible and represent unique assets. ERC-20 tokens can be divided into smaller units, which is not possible for ERC-721 tokens without losing their uniqueness. Both standards can be used to represent ownership of physical assets through tokenization. The incorrect option addresses a common misconception: the value of tokens depends on various factors, not just the standard used. This question encourages critical thinking about the nature and applications of different token standards in blockchain ecosystems.",
