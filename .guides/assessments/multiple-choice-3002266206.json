		"guidance": "The correct answer is \"Enabling dynamic NFTs that change based on external events.\" Oracles play a crucial role in NFT applications by providing external data that can influence the attributes or appearance of dynamic NFTs. This allows NFTs to evolve based on real-world events, time, or other off-chain data sources. The other options, while related to NFT technology, are not primary functions of oracles. Minting NFTs, storing metadata, determining rarity, and managing marketplace contracts are typically handled by other blockchain components or smart contracts themselves, not oracles. This question tests the student's understanding of the specific roles oracles play in enhancing the functionality and interactivity of NFTs by bridging the gap between on-chain and off-chain data.",
