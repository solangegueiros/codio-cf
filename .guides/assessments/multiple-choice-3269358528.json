The backend code of dApps runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer network\n2. dApps can include smart contracts written by other developers\n3. dApps are deterministic, performing the same function regardless of the execution environment\n4. dApps are isolated and executed in the Ethereum Virtual Machine\n\nThese statements accurately reflect the characteristics of dApps as described in the topic. dApps operate on decentralized networks, can use smart contracts from various sources, are deterministic in their execution, and run in isolated environments like the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The incorrect options state that dApps run on centralized servers (they don't, they're decentralized) and that the frontend must be hosted on decentralized storage (it can be, but it's not a requirement).",
