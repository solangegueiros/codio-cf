This accurately describes the Proof of Authority mechanism, which relies on a group of pre-chosen authoritative nodes (validators) to check transactions and create new blocks. The other options are incorrect because: the second option describes Proof of Work, not Proof of Authority; the third option describes Proof of Stake; and the fourth option describes a more decentralized system, which is not characteristic of PoA's permissioned nature.",
