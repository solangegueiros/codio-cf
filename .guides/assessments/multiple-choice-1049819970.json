		"guidance": "The correct answer is \"Blockchain enables decentralized governance through smart contracts, allowing stakeholders to participate in decision-making without relying on centralized authorities.\" This accurately reflects a key application of blockchain technology in governance, particularly through Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Blockchain allows for transparent, tamper-resistant voting and decision-making processes, enabling communities to govern projects and allocate resources without centralized control. The other options are incorrect: Blockchain's use in governance extends beyond cryptocurrency voting, it has practical applications already being implemented in various organizations, it can benefit organizations of all sizes, and it can handle complex decision-making processes beyond just financial decisions. This question assesses students' understanding of how blockchain technology can revolutionize governance and decision-making processes, moving beyond its well-known applications in finance and supply chain management.",
