		"guidance": "The correct answer is \"A DAO votes on Ethereum to allocate funds from its treasury on Polygon to a new project.\" This scenario demonstrates a practical application of cross-chain token transfers in a DAO context. It involves a governance decision on one chain (Ethereum) that results in the movement of funds on another chain (Polygon), showcasing true cross-chain interoperability and token transfer. The other options, while related to multi-chain operations, do not specifically demonstrate cross-chain token transfers: using multiple wallets for voting, off-chain voting for token distribution, automatic rebalancing, and viewing balances across chains don't necessarily involve the transfer of tokens between different blockchains as a result of a governance decision.",
