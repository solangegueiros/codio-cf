		"guidance": "The correct answer is \"A user transfers tokens from Ethereum to Avalanche and automatically stakes them in a yield farming protocol on Avalanche in a single transaction.\" This scenario demonstrates the key feature of programmable token bridges: combining token bridging with arbitrary messaging to execute a contract call on the destination chain in a single transaction. It showcases the ability to not just transfer tokens cross-chain, but also to immediately use them in a specific way (staking in this case) on the destination chain. The other options either involve separate manual steps, don't involve cross-chain transactions, or don't demonstrate the programmable aspect of modern token bridges.",
