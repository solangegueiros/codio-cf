The main use case is providing real-time price data for decentralized exchanges and DeFi applications, which is crucial for many blockchain-based financial services. The other options are incorrect because they represent different Chainlink services or unrelated blockchain concepts: cross-chain token transfers are handled by Chainlink's CCIP, generating random numbers is done through Chainlink VRF, automating smart contracts is a function of Chainlink Automation, and facilitating private computations is not a specific Chainlink service.",
