		"guidance": "The correct answer is \"Cryptocurrencies were one of the first and remain a major use case for blockchain, enabling decentralized digital transactions.\" This statement accurately reflects the historical context and current significance of cryptocurrencies in the blockchain ecosystem. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was also the first major application of blockchain technology. Cryptocurrencies continue to be a primary use case for blockchain, leveraging its decentralized and secure nature for digital financial transactions. The other options are incorrect: Cryptocurrencies are not the only application of blockchain, as blockchain has many other use cases across various industries. Blockchain technology was actually developed first and cryptocurrencies were built on top of it, not vice versa. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are closely intertwined, not separate technologies. Finally, cryptocurrencies use blockchain for much more than just data storage - the blockchain is integral to the transaction process itself.",
