		"guidance": "The correct answer is \"Eliminating the need for existing backend systems.\" This is NOT a benefit of cross-chain oracles for enterprise systems. In fact, cross-chain oracles serve as middleware that connects existing backend systems to multiple blockchain networks, rather than eliminating them. The other options are all actual benefits of using cross-chain oracles: they reduce development time by avoiding individual integrations, enable quick adaptation to market demands, allow connection to multiple blockchain networks, and facilitate support for various smart contract services. This question tests the student's ability to distinguish between the true advantages of cross-chain oracles and a misconception about their purpose in enterprise systems.",
