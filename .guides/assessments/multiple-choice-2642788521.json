		"guidance": "The correct answer is \"A mnemonic phrase can be used to restore a wallet on different devices or applications\". This is a key feature of mnemonic phrases, allowing users to recover their wallets across various platforms. The other options are incorrect because: sharing mnemonic phrases with anyone, including support staff, compromises security; mnemonic phrases are used for various cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin; lost mnemonic phrases cannot be regenerated for existing wallets; and mnemonic phrases typically consist of 12 or 24 words, not 5-10.",
