		"guidance": "The correct answers are:\n1. Gas fees are paid in Ether and are used to compensate miners/validators for their computational work\n2. Gas limits prevent smart contracts from consuming excessive computational resources\n3. Gas fees help prevent spam and potential denial-of-service attacks on the Ethereum network\n\nThese statements accurately reflect the role and implications of gas in Ethereum. Gas fees compensate miners/validators, gas limits control resource consumption, and the fee structure helps secure the network. The incorrect options state that gas fees are constant (they vary with network congestion), that out-of-gas transactions are partially executed (they are reverted entirely), and that gas is determined solely by Ether transferred (it's based on computational complexity).",
