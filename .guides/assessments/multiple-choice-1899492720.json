		"guidance": "The correct answers highlight the similarities and differences between blockchain and traditional banking:\n\n1. Sharing the public key or account number to receive funds is safe in both systems.\n2. The private key in blockchain and a bank account password are both critical for account security and authorizing transactions.\n3. Blockchain offers less privacy, as knowing a public address allows viewing of balance and transaction history, unlike traditional banking.\n\nThe incorrect options are:\n1. 'Both blockchain and traditional banking systems offer the same level of transaction privacy': This is false. Blockchain transactions are generally more transparent.\n2. 'Bank account details and blockchain public keys both give others the ability to withdraw funds': This is false. While public keys allow viewing of information in blockchain, they don't permit withdrawals, similar to how bank account numbers alone don't allow withdrawals.",
