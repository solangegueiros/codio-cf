It supports transfers between various blockchain networks, not limited to just EVM-compatible chains. CCIP can handle the transfer from Ethereum to Avalanche, executing necessary functions on both ends. Furthermore, CCIP comes with built-in security measures, leveraging Chainlink's proven oracle networks, so developers don't need to implement their own security for cross-chain transfers. The other options are incorrect as they either understate CCIP's capabilities or misrepresent its functionality.",
