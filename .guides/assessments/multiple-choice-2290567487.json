		"guidance": "The correct answer is that independent key holders prevent centralized control and reduce the risk of collusion, enhancing network security. This is fundamental to CCIP's design, as it distributes control across multiple independent parties, eliminating single points of failure and reducing the risk of malicious activities. The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the role of key holders (e.g., suggesting they only affect transaction speed or are centrally managed) or understate their importance to network security and decentralization.",
