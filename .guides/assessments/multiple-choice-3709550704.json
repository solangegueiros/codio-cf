		"guidance": "This question assesses understanding of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in blockchain technology. The correct options highlight key characteristics: NFTs represent unique digital assets with distinct identifiers and are commonly used for digital art, collectibles, and gaming assets. The incorrect options address common misconceptions: NFTs cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis (that describes fungible tokens), their value can fluctuate based on market conditions and perceived worth, and they cannot be divided into smaller units without losing their uniqueness. This question encourages critical thinking about the nature and applications of NFTs in blockchain ecosystems, contrasting them with fungible tokens.",
