		"guidance": "This question assesses understanding of the security and trust features in asset tokenization. The correct options highlight key aspects: enhanced security through decentralization, immutable ownership records, and easy verification of ownership claims. The incorrect options address common misconceptions: while tokenization enhances security, it doesn't make assets immune to all cyber attacks, and it doesn't completely eliminate the need for third-party verification in all cases. This question encourages critical thinking about the security benefits and limitations of tokenized assets.",
