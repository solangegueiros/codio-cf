They are connected to Ethereum via bridges, allowing for asset transfers between chains. Side chains can have their own native cryptocurrencies, as seen with examples like Polygon. However, they do not always use the same consensus mechanism as Ethereum; they can have their own. Additionally, side chains do not inherit their security directly from Ethereum; they have their own security models, which is a key difference from Layer 2 solutions.",
