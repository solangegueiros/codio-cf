		"guidance": "Chainlink's Data Streams service is specifically designed to provide secure and reliable high-frequency, low-latency market data for ultra-fast derivatives products. This data can be consumed offchain and cryptographically verified onchain, making it ideal for applications that require real-time, high-speed data updates. The other options are more suited to Chainlink's Data Feeds service, which provides a wider range of data types at lower update frequencies, or are not specific Chainlink services. Daily price updates, weather data, sports scores, and exchange rate data for stablecoins typically don't require the high-frequency, low-latency capabilities of Data Streams and are better served by standard Data Feeds.",
